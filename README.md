## Physiological Cycles Column Explanation

- **Cycle.start.time:** Start time for all data taken throughout a day.
- **Cycle.end.time:** End time for all data taken throughout a day.
- **Cycle.timezone:** Timezone where the data was taken.
- **Recovery.score..:** Numerical score from 1-100 which dictates a general aerobic recovery. 50 is considered a baseline.
- **Resting.heart.rate..bpm.:** Average heartrate during sleep. (beats / minute)
- **Heart.rate.variability..ms.:** Heart Rate Variability during sleep. (milliseconds)
- **Skin.temp..celsius.:** Average skin temperature during sleep (celsius)
- **Blood.oxygen..:** Blood Oxygen Percentage during sleep
- **Day.Strain:** Numerical strain value from measured from 0 to 21.0. This is measured on a log scale so strain values become harder to achieve as one gets closer to 21. A 21.0 strain value would indicate that the person has sustained their maximum heart rate for a full 24 hours.
- **Energy.burned..cal.:** Energy burned over a day (calories)
- **Max.HR..bpm.:** Maximum recorded heart rate over a day (beats / minute)
- **Average.HR..bpm.:** Average recorded heart rate over a day (beats / minute)
- **Sleep.onset:** Time the subject began going to sleep for the night. This time should be considered the time when the subject got into bed, not when the actually fell asleep.
- **Wake.onset:** Time the subject got out of bed in the morning. This is not the same as the wake-up time.
- **Sleep.performance..:** The ratio of hours of sleep the subject got to the hours of sleep the subject needed. Measured from 0% to 100%.
- **Respiratory.rate..rpm.:** Average breath rate during sleep (breaths / minute)
- **Asleep.duration..min.:** Total time asleep (minutes)
- **In.bed.duration..min.:** Total time in bed (minutes)
- **Light.sleep.duration..min.:** Total time spent in "light sleep." This is considered by Whoop as the transitional time between being fully asleep and awake, or vice versa. (minutes)
- **Deep..SWS..duration..min.:** Total time spent in Deep/Slow Wave Sleep. (minutes)
- **REM.duration..min.:** Total time spent in Rapid Eye Movement Sleep. (minutes)
- **Awake.duration..min.:** Total time spent awake in bed. (minutes)
- **Sleep.need..min.:** Calculated sleep need. Based on previous day strain, sleep debt, recent naps, and a predetermined baseline (minutes)
- **Sleep.debt..min.:** Sleep debt. Total amount of sleep needed to "get back on track" (minutes)
- **Sleep.efficiency..:** Ratio of time asleep to time in bed. This is on a scale from 0% to 100%.
